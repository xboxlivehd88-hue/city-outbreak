# CITY OUTBREAK — NEXT CHAT HANDOFF

Read CITY_OUTBREAK_HANDOFF.md first. It is the authoritative full project state.

## Current working checkpoint

- Current modular build: v260
- Current modular gameplay/file-structure checkpoint: 29c3b445c75952dd264f8f844333c88db0b51c40
- Last fully approved pre-modular gameplay baseline: v257
- v257 commit: 138e961c2597cb5ff6099798314d1f40308388c4

The user has reached the conversation limit and wants development continued in the next chat.

## What just happened

We started splitting the giant index.html into real files.

Current live structure:
- index.html — HTML/UI shell and import map
- src/game.css — live CSS
- src/game.js — main live runtime
- src/zombie-rig-data.js — exact live zombie rig data imported by game.js

Important:
- src/audio.js exists but is NOT live.
- Audio extraction caused sound to disappear.
- Proven audio code was restored inline in src/game.js.
- Do not re-import src/audio.js without carefully reworking and testing it.

The first CSS extraction also broke the start-screen image because relative URLs changed.
Current correct CSS path is:
- ../assets/city-outbreak-start-v153.jpg.jpg

Current index.html cache-busts:
- ./src/game.css?v=260
- ./src/game.js?v=260

## First thing to do next chat

1. Fetch current main:index.html.
2. Fetch current src/game.js.
3. Fetch current src/game.css.
4. Read CITY_OUTBREAK_HANDOFF.md.
5. Preserve the current v260 behavior exactly before further modularization.

## Current task to continue

Continue item #2: modularize the game safely.

Do it ONE self-contained system at a time.

Recommended next target:
- UI-only helpers, performance HUD, or simple utilities.

Avoid next:
- audio
- weapons
- reload code
- zombie AI/pathing

Weapons/zombies/reloads have been heavily tuned and are high-risk.

After every extraction:
1. commit directly to main
2. update cache-bust if needed
3. re-fetch/verify
4. give the user a GitHub Pages test link
5. wait for user testing before extracting another major system

## Regression checklist after every extraction

Must still work:
- start screen visible
- Start Outbreak works
- Controls modal works
- game starts
- sound works
- M17 irons hit where aimed
- M4 unchanged
- MP5 unchanged
- all reload animations unchanged
- zombies path correctly
- no zombie ping-pong
- shop opens
- shop low-power freeze works
- Ready resumes
- pause works
- restart works
- performance HUD works

If an extraction breaks any of these, fix/revert it before proceeding.

## Locked reload rule

Do not change any reload animation unless the user explicitly asks for that specific weapon.

Especially preserve:
- M4 reload
- MP5 reload
- M17 reload

## M17 current state

- ADS: pistol:{x:-.36,y:.058,z:-.32,fov:55,rx:.045}
- actual bullet ray is true screen center
- pistolAdsZero=0
- hit marker centered
- 16-round mag
- effectively unlimited reserve
- reload locked

## Zombie pathing current state

Preserve:
- MAX_ACTIVE_ZOMBIES = 20
- full-city A* navigation
- nav X about -148 to 148
- nav Z about -158 to 164
- node budget 2600
- reachable spawn checks
- stuck-side probing instead of blind flip
- last-five rush behavior

## Shop optimization current state

Store low-power mode:
- freezes simulation
- freezes game timers
- suspends audio
- 3D background about 4 FPS
- throttles frame callback
- blocks gameplay hotkeys
- resumes exact game time on Ready

## User workflow

The user wants the assistant to:
- do the GitHub work directly
- not give Git instructions
- keep changes small
- provide live test links
- use screenshots as ground truth
- avoid touching approved systems without a reason

Do not trust old src/config.js, src/main.js, src/weapons.js, or src/zombies.js. They are stale scaffolding, not the live source of truth.
